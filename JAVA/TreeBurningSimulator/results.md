1. Why did you choose the board size for your finalized table?

  * I chose this board size because it seemed like a reasonably big enough board to get results from.


2. Why did you choose the number of repetitions size for your finalized table?

  * I chose this number of repetitions because 100 was too small to be accurate because the averages I got still had a relatively wide range, so I did 1000 to have a much more accurate average.  


3. What did your testing show about changing the board size?

  * Changing the board size only really had an effect around 50-60% density. For example at size 100, 60% took about 200 ticks while at size 500 it took about 1500 ticks.


4. Knowing that there were differences based on board size, what was the relationship between the board size and the maximum burn time? How did you test this?

  * The maximum burn time was about double the size. At size 100, the max burn time was about 200. At size 400 the max burn time was about 800.


5. What density of trees yields the maximum burn time?

  * 60%
